It can be split logically into three big parts: EVAdb The main user-facing application for variant filtration, annotation. This part will be most often used by normal users aiming to gain insights into their datasets. Admin Application The admin application is the backend of EVAdb. It can be used to create samples as well as managing data access permissions and relationships between groups of or individual samples. Solexa Lims System EVAdb also features a LIMS system for use by wet lab groups. Through this interface, additional information for samples can be provided. Most of the information relating to this part of the application is retrieved from the dna extraction and sequencing processes. We provide setup and usage guides for EVAdb and the Admin Application here. EVAdb The main user interface of the application. With the user interface provided by this application users are able to filter variants based on pre-defined strategies such as autosomal dominant (among others). Admin Application The admin application is used to set meta data and permissions for individual or groups of samples. Selected users should have access to this part of the application to manage sample ingress and curate the available data.","title":"Software Architecture"},{"location":"architecture/#software-architecture","text":"EVAdb is built as a collection of perl modules on top of a MySQL database.

Please make sure that you have a basic understanding of docker and how the web works before setting up this website. In order to follow setup and usage guides, it is important that you have an understanding on docker, SSL certificates (for https) and the performance of the system you are hosting your database at. Physical Infrastructure Hardware Requirements To be able to host EVAdb, the hardware must have: 4TB NVMe/SSD Storage Additional performance improvements are gained by utilizing more RAM and CPU Power. EVAdb is meant to host multiple thousand exome cases. As is the case with such datasets, even storing only variants will have the database growing to be multiple terabytes in size. In order to have a nice user experience for the frontend, it is important that the backend database does not bog down even for large requests (f.e. all autosomal dominant variants for one sample). To be able to scale the amount of data, we recommend a physical server utilizing NVMe (or at least SSD) storage technologies. This will greatly increase the database performance for all queries. Make sure you have enough storage available for the expected amount of data. The initialized application will consume around 400GB without any cases added. Spinning Rust We advise heavily against running the databse on older HDD type storage media. Performance will be abysmal. Docker Docker Docker is a isolation technique prevalent in modern software development since it allows the automatic deployment of complex software stacks. Read more: Docker Get Started Docker Setup To be able to host EVAdb through Docker Images, make sure you have installed and correctly configured: Docker docker-compose If you desire to install the application via Docker, please familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of Docker. To deploy the application, we use docker-compose which allows us to deploy the stack of multiple containers through use of a single command. Please follow the installation instructions for docker on your favorite operating system over at docker.com . Some operating systems might need additional setup after installation of docker, typically adding the active user to the docker group. Make sure you follow these steps as well (postinstallation) . To be able to continue with the installation guide, please also install docker-compose .","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"installation/docker/prerequisites/#prerequisites","text":"In order to run the docker version of EVAdb in a secure and performant manner, some prerequisites need to be fulfilled.
